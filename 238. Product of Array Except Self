    #my own answer 
    
    #multiplation is 1. i in range is 0 because of starting. 
    #i = 0 then mul = 1 
    #i working on outer loop and j is working on inner loop 
    #except nums[1] we dont need to multiply 
    #else if at position 1 we will multiply 2,3,4 giving us 24. then setting it up as final output = [i]=mul will give us the right positioning
